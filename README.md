# Code Quiz

As an assignment, I had to create a timed quiz which also stored highscores. I used JavaScript to create HTML elements to create a dynamically changing web page. I used event listeners to trigger action based on events and also used intervals to create a countdown timers. Lastly, I also used the local storage to store the highscores.
